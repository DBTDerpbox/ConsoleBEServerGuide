# DNS Method

This method may not always work! If you have any issues, please [check the BedrockConnect Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/wiki/Troubleshooting)

## Steps

*This is a paraphrased version of [GeyserMC's Guide](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Using-Geyser-with-Consoles#playstation-4) because I do not have a PS4 to test with*

1. Enter settings

2. Go to Network Settings

3. Select `Set Up Internet Connection`

4. If you are using an ethernet/wired connection, select `Use LAN Cable`, if not select `Use Wi-Fi`

5. Select `Custom Network Creation`

6. Select `Automatic IP Address`

7. When it comes to DHCP hostname, make sure to select `Do Not Specify`

8. Set your DNS mode to Manual

9. Set your Primary DNS to any of the [BedrockConnect Instances](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect#publicly-available-bedrockconnect-instances), i'd suggest `104.238.130.180`, *but keep in mind that address is prone to breaking on playstation*

10. Set your Secondary DNS to any DNS server you'd like, just as long as its functional, `8.8.8.8` for example

11. Relaunch Minecraft

12. Connect to a featured server

And we are done! From here you should be able to set up custom server addresses to connect to
