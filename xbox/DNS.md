# DNS Method

This method may not always work! If you have any issues, please [check the BedrockConnect Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect/wiki/Troubleshooting)

## Steps

1. Enter settings

2. Go to Network Settings

3. Go to `Advanced Settings`

4. Select `DNS settings`

5. Set your DNS mode to Manual

6. Set your Primary DNS to any of the [BedrockConnect Instances](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect#publicly-available-bedrockconnect-instances), i'd suggest `104.238.130.180`

7. Set your Secondary DNS to any DNS server you'd like, just as long as its functional, `8.8.8.8` for example

8. Relaunch Minecraft

9. Connect to a featured server

And we are done! From here you should be able to set up custom server addresses to connect to
