# DNS Method

This method requires you to edit your networking settings, if you have parental controls enabled, make sure to know the password before proceeding

## Steps

1. Enter system settings

2. Go to Internet Settings

3. Select the network you are currently connected to

4. Select `Change Settings`

5. Set your DNS mode to Manual

6. Set your Primary DNS to any of the [BedrockConnect Instances](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect#publicly-available-bedrockconnect-instances), i'd suggest `104.238.130.180`

7. Set your Secondary DNS to any DNS server you'd like, just as long as its functional, `8.8.8.8` for example

8. Save your new settings, and relaunch Minecraft

9. Connect to a featured server

And we are done! From here you should be able to set up custom server addresses to connect to
